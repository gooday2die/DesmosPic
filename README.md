# DesmosPics
Turn your picture into Desmos graphs.

## Special Thanks to
- The source code that turns picture into series of Desmos graphs were achieved by [kevinjycui](https://github.com/kevinjycui) in his project [DesmosBezierRenderer](https://github.com/kevinjycui/DesmosBezierRenderer).
- [Desmos](https://desmos.com/) themselves! Needed to modify their official API's javascript code a bit in order to make this thing working.

## What is this?
This is a website (or API at the same time) that turns your picture into Desmos Graphs.
